# Legal: Imprint & Privacy Policy

<div class='abstract'>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    For legal reasons (<b>GDPR</b>) I am required to make a <code>Privacy Policy</code> and link it from every page. 
    Per german law, I am also required to make an <code>Impressum</code>. 
    This document acts as both. 
</div>


## Overview

Within this document, `you` (and `your`) refers to the `data subject` (in the sense of GDPR). 

`I` (as well as `me` and `my`) refers to:

    Tom Wiesing
    Thomas (dash) Mann (dash) Str (dot) (space) Sixty-Four
    two eight two one three Bremen
    Germany
    Phone (colon) Zero Zero Four Nine (space) Four Two One (space) Two Two Three Four Nine Seven Four
    E (dash) Mail (colon) legal (at) tkw01536 (dot) de

Please only contact me at this address (digitally or physically) when it is legally required. 
See <a href="https://tkw01536.de" target="_blank">my homepage</a> for other means of getting in touch with me. 

Within the scope of GDPR I act as a data controller. 
You can also consider me as the Data Protection Officer for my websites. 

Except where explicitly mentioned otherwise, I am running my pages for personal, non-commerical reasons only. 
In particular, I don't make any money from running them. 

I process two kinds of data relating to you:

1. I will process data about you that is required for my website(s) to function
2. I will process anonymized data about you for statistical purposes about my websites. 

You can read more details about both categories below. 

### Required Data For my Website(s) to Function

When you use my website, your browser must establish a connection with the server. 
When it does, it is required to transmit the following information:

- Your IP address and port number, so that my server can send the content of my websites to your browser to display. 
- The website name and exact website URL you request, so that my server knows which website to send to you. 
- Types of encryption supported by your browser, so that the server can encrypt the content of my website and send it to you without others knowning about it. 
- If you previously visited a website, when you last visited it, so that my server does not have to send you the website again if it has not changed. 

Your browser might transmit additional information, including but not limited to:
- Content(s) of various cookies
- Which website(s) you visited immediatly preceeding my website(s)
- The name and version of your browser

Except where absolutely required, my server does not directly process this information. 
In some cases, as outlined in the next section, my server might store an anonymized version for statistical purposes. 
Otherwise, all information is destroyed as soon as it is no longer needed. 

I do not have any control over the extra information your browser submits. 
If you do not wish to transmit this extra information please configure your browser appropriatly. 

None of the categories in this section allow me to identify you without additional information. 
By the time you could provide me with additional information that would allow me to identify you, any non-anonymized data about you would already be deleted. 
Therefore as per `GDPR Article 11, Paragraph 2`, Articles 15 - 20 of GDPR do not apply to data collected in this category. 

### Anonymized data for statistical purposes

For statistical purposes, I collect the following data:

- Exact URL(s) of websites you requested
- Which website(s) you visited immediatly preceeding my website(s)
- How long you stayed on my website
- the Browser Version(s), Operation System(s), and Device(s) you are using to visit my website. 
- the resolution of your screen
- the language your browser is configured for
- an anonymized version of your IP address

All data is collected in pseudonymised form. 
Categories are collected independently, and no creation of unique user profiles takes place. 
Furthermore, no cookie(s) are set for collecting this data. 

`GDPR Rectial 26` states "`the principles of data protection should [...] not apply to anonymous information`". 
Therefore GDPR is not applicable to this data, and GDPR does not grant you any special rights for this purpose.

## Cookie Policy

Some of my websites use cookies for essential purposes to allow persistent user sessions. 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) says that

> A [...] cookie (also called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie, or simply cookie) is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser while the user is browsing. 

I will use cookies only where neccessary. 
In particular, cookies are not used for tracking purposes. 

Not all my sites use cookies. 
In principle only sites not intended for the general public (such as those that require a login) use cookies. 
However there are some exceptions. 
If a site uses cookies, the link to this document will contain the text ```This site makes use of cookies for essential features ```.
