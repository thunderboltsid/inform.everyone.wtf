Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments\nlong established should not be changed for light and transient causes;\nand accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed\nto suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing\nthe forms to which they are accustomed.  But when a long train of abuses and\nusurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce\nthem under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw\noff such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.\n--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now\nthe necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.\nThe history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated\ninjuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment\nof an absolute Tyranny over these States.  To prove this, let Facts\nbe submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary\nfor the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate\nand pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation\ntill his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended,\nhe has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of\nlarge districts of people, unless those people would relinquish\nthe right of Representation in the Legislature, a right\ninestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\n\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,\nuncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their\nPublic Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them\ninto compliance with his measures.\n\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing\nwith manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions,\nto cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers,\nincapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large\nfor their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed\nto all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States;\nfor that purpose obstructing the Laws of Naturalization of Foreigners;\nrefusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither,\nand raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\n\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent\nto Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.\n\nHe has made judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure\nof their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of\nOfficers to harass our People, and eat out their substance.\n\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies\nwithout the Consent of our legislatures.\n\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of\nand superior to the Civil Power.\n\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction\nforeign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws;\ngiving his Assent to their Acts of pretended legislation:\n\nFor quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\n\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders\nwhich they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\n\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\n\nFor imposing taxes on us without our Consent:\n\nFor depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\n\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:\n\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring\nProvince, establishing therein an Arbitrary government,\nand enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once\nan example and fit instrument for introducing the same\nabsolute rule into these Colonies:\n\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws,\nand altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\n\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves\ninvested with Power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection\nand waging War against us.\n\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns,\nand destroyed the lives of our people.\n\nHe is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries\nto compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun\nwith circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the\nmost barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of the Head of a civilized nation.\n\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas\nto bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of\ntheir friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\n\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has\nendeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers,\nthe merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare,\nis an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress\nin the most humble terms:  Our repeated Petitions have been answered\nonly by repeated injury.  A Prince, whose character is thus marked\nby every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler\nof a free People.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attention to our Brittish brethren.\nWe have warned them from time to time of attempts by their\nlegislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.\nWe have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and\nsettlement here.  We have appealed to their native justice\nand magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our\ncommon kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably\ninterrupt our connections and correspondence.  They too have been\ndeaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.  We must, therefore,\nacquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them,\nas we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America,\nin General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of\nthe world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name,\nand by the Authority of the good People of these Colonies,\nsolemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are,\nand of Right ought to be Free and Independent States;\nthat they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown,\nand that all political connection between them and the State\nof Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved;\nand that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to\nlevy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce,\nand to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may\nof right do.
